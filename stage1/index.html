            <p>The men of LA are out for a little revenge. After losing in 6 games to eventual champs, Cubs in 2016, they are back and ready
            to attack. After a record-setting pace of wins nearly three quarters of the way through the regular season, the Dodgers made
          quick work of Arizona and are itching to do the same to Chicago.

          <h3 class="team"> The Cubs </h3>
            <p>Break a 108 year old curse and have a chance to win two World Series in a row?! Maybe the world truly <em> IS </em> ending...
            The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qWbqfCBoUI"> Brizzo brothers </a> are now seasoned vets on this team full of youth, and along with eccentric skipper, Joe Madden,
            will lead this team deep into the NLCS series, if not all the way to a repeat appearance in the <b>World Series</b>.

          <h3 class="team"> Yankees </h3>
            <p> Guess who's back after a year hiatus from October baseball? The boys in the pinstripes. If you ask someone in the Bronx, it probably feels
        like the last time the Yanks were still in contention, <a href="http://www.reggiejackson.com/"> Mr. October himself </a> was lacing up. Behind a 6 foot 7 inch monster of a right
        fielder, NY can hit the long ball (and a lot of them) if they get hot.

          <h3 class="team"> Houston </h3>
            <p><em>No problems here...</em> Houston may not be the blue chip, tradition-rich team on this list, but they are just as capable to do serious damage and find
          themselves playing for a WS title. Their hero, Jose Altuve, may be short in stature (5 feet 4 inches). But, what he lacks in height he makes up for in
          hits, homeruns, and heart.
